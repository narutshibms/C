non, le rÃ©pertoire rep est vide et ne contient aucun fichier.

after execurtin "ls -ai" it shows address of cache just . 

and after  execute "ls -ali" it shows address of caches and modified time and size of it in bytes and also username and all of it has saperated in columns.  


the command "ls -id rep" shows after executing address of  the repertoire given.

the command "ls -id ~" shows address of the Home repertoire. (address  /home).

the command ("ls -ali ~/rep" and "ls --ali") are giving the same results which is details of (rep&rep1) directory . results come first by address of files &(cache) , last modified time , user access name ,and 

some expressions with unknow names such  " drwxr-xr-x ".

 the command ("ls -ail ../.. " & "ls-ail~") shows the same result that is the same as last 2 commands : ("ls -ali ~/rep" and "ls --ali") 

but not only shows details of (rep&rep1) but also shows all systemes directories details exclude /Home &/music /videos and caches and all other hidden files.

in conclusion both of  ("ls -ali ~/rep" and "ls --ali") && ("ls -ail ../.. " & "ls-ail~")  but the last two are more general and shows all directory details .

8-9 : after executing command ("touch fich1.txt" && "touch fich2") it's creat fich.txt and fich2 as doc in directory rep.

"cd .." :after executing this command which it takes you 2 steps back ,we I execute ("rmdir") which would delete directory rep but this command canot delete the directory rep .

and to know why this command cannot delete it we have to test ("ls -la rep ") , after executing this command it shows that still there some cashes and data in rep althought we have deleted (fich1 & fich2).

conclusion ->> the reason why rep cannot be deleted is that it still contien many data such caches for that the command "rmdir" cannot delete it .
